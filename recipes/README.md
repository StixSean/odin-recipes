# odin-recipes
Practising all of HTML knowledge i have acquired, in this project i will build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page. The website wont look very pretty by the time i've finished without CSS.
I will revisit this project when i learn CSS.

Have now revisitied the page and added CSS to style the "cabonara" recipe and make it look a little better.
