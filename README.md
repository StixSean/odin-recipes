# odin-recipes
Practising all of HTML knowledge i have acquired, in this project i will build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few repies. The website wont lok very pretty by the time i've finished without CSS.
I will revisit this project when i learn CSS.
